# Quickstart for plaid-node

To run this application locally, first install it and then run either of the flows described below. Additionally, please also refer to the [Quickstart guide](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart).

## Installing the quickstart app
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/plaid/quickstart.git
cd quickstart/node
npm install
```

## The canonical flow
``` bash
# Start the Quickstart with your API keys from the Dashboard
# https://dashboard.plaid.com/account/keys
#
# PLAID_PRODUCTS is a comma-separated list of products to use when
# initializing Link. Note that this list must contain 'assets' in
# order for the app to be able to create and retrieve asset reports.

PLAID_CLIENT_ID='CLIENT_ID' \
PLAID_SECRET='SECRET' \
PLAID_PUBLIC_KEY='PUBLIC_KEY' \
PLAID_ENV='sandbox' \
PLAID_PRODUCTS='transactions' \
PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES='US,CA,GB,FR,ES' \
node index.js

# Go to http://localhost:8000
```

## The OAuth redirect flow
Some European institutions require an OAuth redirect authentication flow, where the end user is redirected to the bankâ€™s website or mobile app to authenticate. For this flow, you should provide two additional configuration parameters, `PLAID_OAUTH_NONCE` and `PLAID_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`.

``` bash
# You will need to whitelist the PLAID_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI for
# your client ID through the Plaid developer dashboard at
# https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api.
#
# Set PLAID_OAUTH_NONCE to a unique identifier such as a UUID.
# The nonce must be at least 16 characters long.
#
# Start the Quickstart with your API keys from the Dashboard
# https://dashboard.plaid.com/account/keys
#
# PLAID_PRODUCTS is a comma-separated list of products to use when
# initializing Link.

PLAID_CLIENT_ID='CLIENT_ID' \
PLAID_SECRET='SECRET' \
PLAID_PUBLIC_KEY='PUBLIC_KEY' \
PLAID_ENV='sandbox' \
PLAID_PRODUCTS='transactions' \
PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES='GB' \
PLAID_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI='http://localhost:8000/oauth-response.html' \
